GIT CONCEPTS
------------

*  Revolution in storage:  

   -  Instead of being diff-based, the storage is a file system
      composed of commits, trees and blobs.

   -  Diffs are computed instead of being the basis of the storage.

   -  Storage takes mucho more space.

*  Revolution in local content:

   -  The local content contais all?? history and branches of the
      project.

   -  All "first-line" checkouts and commits are done locally.

   -  The intermediate "pre-commit" layer (called "index" or "stage")
      is managed explicitly.  (Local) commits is done in 2 steps:
      stage and commit.

   -  It is custom to maintain several branches pure locally.


*  Revolution in remote version control hosting

   -  Communication with remote machines is a second step after local
      commits and checkouts.  This makes that in order to promote
      local changes to the remote repository 3 steps could be needed:

      1.  Stage the changes (git add)
      2.  Perform a local commit (git commit)
      3.  Perform a push operation

   -  git is p2p oriented, repositories communicate with each
      other.  There are two ways to exchange commits between
      repositories:

      a)  (default) In a pull-push model through a mapping of local
          and remote branches.

      b)  Through patch extraction + email + patch apply.  This is
          (for the moment) out of scope in this document.

   -  In order to prevent interference in local development with a
      external push the usual push-pull model is implemented with a
      "bare repository" used as a central reference (therefore
      eliminating the notion of p2p).

   -  "Bare repositories" are repositories in which no development is
      made (in contrast with normal or "development" repositories).
      This means that there is no notion of working copy, index,
      current branch or checkouts.

   -  Push-pull communication between development repositories is
      always possible although special care must be taken in order not
      to interfere with the current checked out branch.  Solutions can
      be: 

      *  Either create a local branch with the sole purpose of
         receiving external pushes.  Then the local user has to
         manually merge those pushes in the checked out branch.

      *  Use of a hook macro to automatically:

         -  Abort the push if there is uncommited staging data and/or
            local modifications.
            -  Could there be a solution to do a local commit and then
               an automatic merge?

         -  Abort the push if this results in conflict.

         -  Automatically launch a checkout of the recently added push
            data.



*  Setup of a pull-push model with git.

   -  The process to "setup up a centralized git server" consists of
      the following steps:

      1.  BARE Initialize an empty BARE repository in a directory with .git
          extension (this is a custom).

      2.  Setup the remote access for  this bare repository  (SSH,
          git-daemon, file, HTTP, HTTP-DAV, gitweb cgi...)

      3.  Clone the repository to a local DEVELOPMENT repository.

      4.  In the local repository (and in local branches) add the
          versioned content.

      5.  Stage, commit in the local repository and push the changes
          to the remote repository.

      Alternatively there is anoter way:

      1.  Start from a full local DEVELOPMENT repository having all
          the versioned data commited into it.

      2.  BARE clone this development repository into a bare repository
          (living in a .git directory).

      3.  Transfer the bare repository to the remote location through
          any means (SSH, FTP...)

      4.  Setup the remote access for the transfered bare repository
          (as in step 2 above).

      5.  Either:

          -  Define a remote pointer in the local development
             repository to the remote location of the bare clone.

          -  Replace the local development repository with a clone of
             the remote one (so that the remote pointers are
             automatically established).

*  Ways to setup remote git access:          

   -  github.com and gitourious.org (as well as other forges) provide
      free git hosting.

   -  In order to setup a "git server" in our machine there are the
      following approaches (which can be combined) 

      *  GIT protocol through git-daemon  (TCP port 9418)
         -  Does not include authentication or encription.
         -  A separate process (with possible cooperation with inetd)
            needs to be launched.
         -  Only provides pulling from remote to local.
         -  This increases efficiency in pulling w.r.t. HTTP protocol.

      *  SSH protocol
         -  Just place the remote repository accesible to an SSH user.
         -  Prefered way for push
         -  Allows pull as well (of course)

      *  HTTP(s)
         -  Just place the remote repository accesible in a DocumentRoot
         -  Needs a small change in one of the hooks in the remote repo.
         -  For pulling no action is needed in the HTTP server (all
            the logic lives in the git client).
         -  For pushing DAV needs to be setup as well in the HTTP
            server.
         -  HTTP(s) is not as efficient as git protocol but however is
            much more firewall friendly.

      *  File
         -  Make the remote repository accesible in the file path
            (either in the same machine, with a network filesystem
            such as NFS or any remote mounting).


*  Revolution in branching and merging:

   -  Branch and merge may come from local work and/or remote
      push/pull

   -  Conflicts still appear like in any version control system.  Git
      proposes 3 different solving strategies.

   -  Git allows also to "change history" through the reset and rebase
      operations.

GIT PROCEDURES
--------------

*  Creation of a respository

   -  git init
   -  git clone (based on another) with --bare (if it is going to be a reference).



*  Daily work

   -  git status:  Shows modified files (not staged), new files
                   (untracked) and staged files (not commited).

   -  git add <fichero>:  Stage the file or make it trackable.


   -  git commit <fichero>:  Stage (or make it trackable) + commit

   -  git commit .  (o git commit -a):  Stage + commit the tracked
                    files.  It does not track new files.

*  Daily work (corrections)

   -  git reset <path>:  unstage the path
                The working copy is not affected, it overwrites the
                stage with the HEAD commit version.

                NOTE:  If there are modifications newer from the git
                       add phase, the initial staged version will be lost.


   -  git reset --soft HEAD~:  (note the ~) uncommit
                The index is unchanged but the last commit is left
                unreachable.

                This operation can be done to older commits and then
                commit the index to squash several commits into one.

                The working copy is not affected neither.

                Note that if you just forgot to:

                -  Write a good comment.
                -  Include more files in the staging area.

                a git commit --amend will be an easier way to correct
                the last commit.

   -  git reset [--mixed] HEAD~: (note the ~) uncommit + unadd all the index

                The situation comes before the staging of the working
                copy (which is still left unaffected).

                If a git commit follows no change will happen because
                the staging area will be empty (matching the previous
                commit).
               

   -  git reset --hard HEAD~: (note the ~) uncommit + unadd + restore
                the working copy
  
                A step further, not only the first commit is
                unreachable but the intermediate and working copy
                content have also been overwriten.

                In practical terms ALL the changes of the last commits
                are gone

    -  The previous ones but "HEAD" instead of "HEAD~":

       -  git reset --soft HEAD:  
               Does nothing, since the head still points at the latest
               commit.

       -  git reset [--mixed] HEAD:  Unadd (i.e. unstage) all files
               All files are unstaged as if no git add had been done.

               However both working copy and the commits are
               unaffected.

       -  git reset --hard HEAD:  Unstage the index + restore the
               working copy

               All not commited changes are lost but the commited
               information is not changed.

TODO
----

-  Open an account on github and upload some content (example code,
   Latex presentations...).

-  Explore documentation of git as rsync (or dropbox)

-  Export knowledge tree as a git repository (and place this file
   here).

-  Download linux kernel with git and add the RT branch.  Play around.
